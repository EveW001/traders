Python Tk interface for SpaceTraders.io developed collaboratively.

## Contributing
Before contributing make sure to install the package "pre-commit" (using `pip install pre-commit` or `py -m pip install pre-commit` from a shell, depending on your python version) and then (whilst in this folder) run `pre-commit install`. This will ensure that you're all set to run the necessary pre-commit git triggers and so maintain coding standards. Thank you.
